# Top Trumps

# A small game where players compare stats. The basic flow of the game is:
# 1. You are given a random card with different stats.
# 2. You select one of the card's stats.
# 3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
# 4. The stats of the two cards are compared.
# 5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins. 

# The project will use the Pokemon API
